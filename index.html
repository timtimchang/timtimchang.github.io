My name is Yen-Cheng Chang, and I am a machine learning researcher at <a href="https://www.esunfhc.com/en">E.SUN Financial Holding</a>, where I am conducting research with Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/yirenyeh/home">Yi-Ren Yeh</a> and Professor <a href="http://mirlab.org/jang/">Jyh-Shing Roger Jang</a>. I received my M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at National Taiwan University (NTU) under the guidance of Professor <a href="https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?teacher_id=901166">Tian-Li Yu</a>. Prior to NTU, I received B.S. in Computer Science and Information Engineering from National Taipei University.
<br /><br />

My primary research focuses on domain adaptation, active learning, and synthetic data generating, eliminating the need for manual labels on signal and image processing. For further studies, I am excited about explicitly modeling structure in data for system analysis. At the same time, I am also interested in topics related to potential applications in machine learning systems.
<br /><br />

I have research experience in image & signal processing and machine learning for about three years and published three international conference papers: <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9897599">ICIP 2022</a> (as the first author), <a href="https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/pdfs/interspeech_2022/chen22d_interspeech.pdf">INTERSPEECH 2022</a>, and <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Traditional-Chinese-Synthetic-Datasets-Verified-for-Chen-Chang/41684f5ae2e69e68f91f695a28d09b8c21bb1f57">ICPR workshop 2022</a> . In addition, I got the <a href="http://172.17.11.44:15871/cgi-bin/blockpage.cgi?ws-session=18446744072372217772">NTU EE Best Thesis Award 2020</a>.
